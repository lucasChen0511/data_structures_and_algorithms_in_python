#Write a Python program that can simulate a simple calculator, using the console as the exclusive input and output device.
#  That is, each input to the calculator, be it a number, like 12.34 or 1034, or an operator, like + or =, can be done on 
# a separate line. After each such input, you should output to the Python console what would be displayed on your 
# calculator.
